# Smart-Chemical-Laboratory-Project-IOT
Internet of Things (IOT) Project


This project is focused on designing and implementing a smart chemical laboratory to allow a safe and secure environment for people working in the lab, as well as providing convenience through smart regulation of climate and light. A chemical laboratory is prone to various kinds of accidents e.g. gas leaks or fire. These hazards could be mitigated if there was a system which could detect them at an early stage and notify the users or the responsible authorities. The goal of this project is to build a system which can detect a gas leak or fire, activate an alarm system, and also notify the authorities. 
The lab access is monitored by using RFID technology which grants access to authorized personnel only and logs access. Various sensors are installed in the laboratory for regular monitoring of smoke detection and hazardous gases, which in case of an emergency will trigger actuators like an alarm and a notification about the situation. Further, brightness as well as the temperature will be monitored and actuators like lights and fans will restore the predefined values in case of a deviation. 
As a result, the safety of workers in the lab and their comfort for good working conditions are granted.
